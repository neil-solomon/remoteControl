Add code to reverse direction of wheels on one side of the robot. Motors on the left need to rotate oppositely
of motors on right.

Perhaps use EEPROM of MEGA to remember motorSpeedCompression.

Implement some kind of bug-tracker or crash reporting system. Perhaps just a contact form.

Debug voice control. Add more recognizable direction words.

Use chrome dev tools sensors tab to simulate Use Tilt (will probably need to serve https)

Make sure localstorage can be used to manage path-plannings during offline use.

See if PWA Workbox can do anything cool.

Catch gatt server connection error. It says that bluetooth connects, but no data can be sent, so the password
timeout eventually disconnects it.
Catch DOM exceptions with bluetooth contribute to this problem.

Hide use tilt button when tilt is unavailable.

Debug diagonal-wide-berth path planning.

Continue to test controlsDebounceTime and controlsToZeroTime. The best on my machine is 5, 100 but with 4x cpu throttle
10, 50 is probably the best.

PathPlanningMatrix touchDrag starts by activating the cell that the touch is over, but the cell 
which is activated gets progresssively further ahead of the touch as the touch continues.

Figure out how to run development on mobile.
The issue is that bluetooth and sensor won't work on http, only https.
So I need the react dev server to serve over https, which is easy with 'set HTTPS=true&&npm start'. But the cert is self-signed
so chrome has an issue with it and it wont work on mobile.
Serving https on localhost works, but this makes it not serve at local LAN or WAN ip; serving https on the WAN ip
works on desktop but it wont open on mobile.

setup() can be called from loop()
use a return in loop() to reset loop()

commands to/from arduino starts with number
	passowrd 35

Browser Compatibility:
	Chrome:
		Desktop: everything works
		Mobile: everything works
	Edge: 
		Desktop: everything works
		Mobile: shows bluetooth and the connection dialog opens but it can't see the bluetooth module
	Firefox:
		Desktop: no bluetooth
	Opera:
		Desktop: shows bluetooth but when trying to connect says Web Bluetooth is disabled
