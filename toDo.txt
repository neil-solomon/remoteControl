Control UV lamps via a switch. Switch should be controlled by Arduino (5V) and pass power to the UV lamps (12V).

Include rotation in tilt mode.

Hide use tilt button when tilt in unavailable.

Catch gatt server connection error. It says that bluetooth connects, but no data can be sent, so the password
timeout eventually disconnects it. Also uncaught DOM exceptions contribute to this problem.

Make Controller playback path plannings.
Debug diagonal-wide-berth path planning.
See if localstorage can be used to manage path-plannings during offline use.

Continue to test controlsDebounceTime and controlsToZeroTime. The best on my machine is 5, 100; but with 4x cpu throttle
10, 50 is probably the best.

PathPlanningMatrix touchDrag starts by activating the cell that the touch is over, but the cell 
which is activated gets progresssively further ahead of the touch as the touch continues.

Figure out how to run development on mobile.
The issue is that bluetooth and sensor won't work on http, only https.
So I need the react dev server to serve over https, which is easy with 'set HTTPS=true&&npm start'. But the cert is self-signed
so chrome has an issue with it and it wont work on mobile.
Serving https on localhost works, but this makes it not serve at local LAN or WAN ip; serving https on the WAN ip
works on desktop but it wont open on mobile.

setup() can be called from loop()
use a return in loop() to reset loop()
